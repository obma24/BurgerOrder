BurgerOrderer is an application where you can easily order and customize burgers, choose your favorite toppings, and then either remove items from the cart or confirm the order. The confirmed orders are then sent directly to the kitchen.

This was a team project developed by me and four other students. I learned how important teamwork is â€” not just being good at coding, but also communicating clearly and collaborating with others to reach a common goal. Even though it was a small project, I learned a lot about planning tasks, sharing responsibilities, and supporting each other. This experience showed me that in the professional world, being a good developer also means being a good teammate.

# This is how you start the application!

# Step-by-step instructions:
Step 1: Start the Docker Desktop application. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your computer.

Step 2: Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). By going to the "Terminal" menu and selecting "New Terminal".

Step 3: Enter the following command in the terminal to build and run the application:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Step 4: Open the browser and navigate to the following links to access the application:
 - To start ordering burgers, open [BurgerOrderer](http://localhost:5000), or just search manually (http://localhost:5000/). This gives you access to the application where you can view and customize burgers.

 - For the kitchen staff to view incoming orders, open [KitchenView](http://localhost:5001), or just search manually (http://localhost:5001/). Here, the kitchen staff can see all orders in real time.
