Week 1: Setting Up Configuration Management with GitHub

During the first week, my group and I worked on installing a configuration management tool, specifically GitHub. We started by downloading the latest version of GitHub Desktop from the official GitHub website and installed it on our machines. After installation, we logged in using our GitHub accounts, which enabled us to access our repositories.

Once everything was set up, we watched a tutorial on creating a repository. We learned how to initialize a new repository by clicking on "New Repository" in the GitHub interface, naming it appropriately, and choosing to initialize it with a README file to provide context about the project. After successfully creating the repository, we began testing commits by making changes to the README file. We used the command git add README.md to stage our changes, followed by git commit -m 'Initial commit with project description' to commit our updates. Finally, we pushed the changes using git push origin main to upload them to the remote repository.

However, we encountered a significant issue when two group members attempted to push their commits simultaneously. This caused a merge conflict, leading to some commits not appearing in the repository. With the help of our teacher, we learned how to properly handle commits and avoid such conflicts by ensuring that commits are made one at a time and by pulling the latest changes before pushing new ones. We also discussed the importance of coordinating our pushes to prevent conflicts, realizing that just as users need feedback from the system, team members require clear communication about ongoing changes to maintain a smooth workflow.

Reflection: This week was pivotal for establishing our group’s approach to configuration management throughout the project. Through our experiences with GitHub, I gained insight into the necessity of clear communication and coordination. For instance, one member suggested we use a group chat to inform each other when committing changes, which will help prevent future conflicts. This taught us that proper coordination is essential to maintain system status visibility, aligning with user experience principles.

Moving forward, we will adopt better practices, such as pulling the latest changes from the repository before making any new commits and communicating clearly about who is committing at what time. Additionally, this experience emphasized the value of branching in GitHub, which would allow us to work on separate features without interfering with each other's code. We plan to explore this feature more extensively to streamline our workflow and minimize disruptions.
Overall, this experience served as a critical learning moment that not only deepened my understanding of GitHub but also reinforced the importance of collaboration in software development. I feel better equipped to manage version control in future projects, understanding that a well-coordinated team can significantly improve efficiency and reduce errors.

Week 2: Planning and Understanding Team Roles

This week, after our group discussions on defining individual roles, I focused on creating a structured plan for myself. I realized that having a clear approach would be critical to ensuring that my work contributed effectively to the project. The first step in my plan was to deepen my understanding of my assigned part of the project. By learning more about my responsibilities, I could better align my tasks with the overall project requirements and ensure I was on the right track.

The second step involved expanding my knowledge beyond just my tasks and learning about the roles of my teammates, particularly the parts that were directly related to mine. This gave me a better understanding of how my work would interact with theirs. By familiarizing myself with their responsibilities, I was able to write code that was not only correct for my part but also easy for my teammates to integrate with their work. This approach led me to think critically about the dependencies between our roles and helped me anticipate potential challenges in the collaboration process.

For instance, as I worked on my code, I made conscious decisions to structure it in a way that would simplify my teammate's work. I focused on writing clean, maintainable code that they could easily build on or adapt. This also positioned me to assist them if needed, and because I had learned more about their responsibilities, I was able to offer meaningful help. In addition, while learning about my teammate's tasks, I naturally ended up reading about other related parts of the project, which gave me a broader understanding of the entire system. This comprehensive perspective made me feel more confident about how my role fits into the bigger picture.

Reflections: This week’s planning process was highly beneficial, as it allowed me to understand not just my own role but also how it connects with the roles of others. By learning about both my tasks and my teammates' tasks, I gained deeper insight into the project as a whole. This also improved my ability to collaborate more effectively and contribute to solutions that work well for everyone. Looking ahead, I feel that this understanding will allow me to write code that is well-integrated into the overall system, while also enabling me to offer help and guidance to my teammates when necessary.

I’ve learned that collaboration in software development is not just about doing your part but also ensuring that the way you do your work complements the efforts of others. This deeper understanding of the team’s tasks has given me the tools to write code that not only fulfills my own responsibilities but also anticipates the needs of my teammates, resulting in a more seamless integration of our work.

Week 3: Deepening Understanding and Supporting the Team

Summary of Work
This week, I focused on deepening my understanding of both my tasks and those of my teammates, which allowed me to anticipate potential challenges and collaborate more effectively within the team. As the next stage of development required significant work on the user interface, I prepared by reviewing key concepts in HTML and CSS to ensure I could contribute effectively to the design and front-end development.

At the same time, I spent time assisting my teammates with various tasks related to the UI. Drawing from my high school background in HTML and CSS, I helped structure the layout of the pages and implement basic styling. This collaboration ensured that we progressed smoothly while maintaining consistency in design and code quality.

Building Knowledge and Preparing for the Interface Design
One of my main objectives this week was to fully understand how our tasks interacted, particularly how the user interface would integrate with the backend. This comprehensive understanding was crucial as we transitioned into designing key components like the Burger Orderer and Kitchen View.

To ensure I was prepared, I revisited the fundamental aspects of HTML and CSS, particularly focusing on semantic structure and responsive design. This preparation allowed me to approach the interface design with a solid understanding of how to build a clean, organized layout that would be easy to maintain and scale. I also reviewed best practices for UI/UX design to ensure that the interface would be intuitive for both users and kitchen staff.

Additionally, I continued to enhance my understanding of Docker, which I had started exploring in the previous weeks.

I will also maintain my support for the team, particularly in areas related to HTML and CSS, to ensure that we stay aligned as we move forward. In addition, I will keep expanding my knowledge of Docker and other relevant technologies to ensure I can contribute effectively to all aspects of the project.

Week 4: Designing the User Interface and Kickstarting Development

Purpose & Objectives:
This week’s goal was to establish a clear, functional design for the application's user interface (UI) that serves both the customers (Burger Orderer) and kitchen staff (Kitchen View). The design would act as the blueprint for development, ensuring alignment between team members and guiding the technical implementation. A critical objective was to provide a user-friendly interface that intuitively supports order customization and processing.

Detailed Process:
I began by identifying the key features necessary for the application and how they would interact. The main interface, which I called the Burger Orderer View, needed to allow users to select a type of burger, apply customizations, and then proceed with placing or modifying the order. I sketched this interface with the following components:

Burger Selection: I used radio buttons to enable the selection of a specific burger, ensuring that only one option can be chosen at a time, which simplifies the ordering process for the user.

Customization Options: To offer flexibility, I included checkboxes next to customization options, such as additional ingredients, allowing users to customize their burger according to their preferences.

Cart Section: A critical feature of this view is the cart, where users can review their selected burger and applied customizations. I designed this to include "Remove" and "Order" buttons, enabling users to either remove an item from the cart or finalize their order.

In parallel, I designed the Kitchen View, which is intended for staff to efficiently process and manage orders. This view includes:
Order Display: A summarized list of each order, with the chosen burger and its customizations clearly separated, ensures the kitchen staff can quickly understand what needs to be prepared.

Order Management: I incorporated a "Cancel Order" button, allowing staff to cancel incorrect or redundant orders, ensuring smoother kitchen operations.

Once these wireframes were completed, I reviewed them critically to ensure all user interactions were intuitive and streamlined. I shared the designs with my group mate via our project management system, ensuring they had all the necessary documentation and explanations to proceed with coding.

Collaboration & Team Workflow:
Collaboration played a key role this week. After designing the wireframes, I ensured the sketches were detailed and annotated to avoid miscommunication. I actively engaged with my group mates to ensure they understood the functionality behind each UI element. This allowed them to begin coding the interface in alignment with the design specifications. We also had several follow-up discussions to adjust minor details and ensure we were on the same page, preventing future rework and maintaining efficiency. By clarifying the visual and functional requirements early on, we were able to avoid confusion and streamline the implementation process.

Reflection:
This week’s work underscored the importance of thorough planning in UI/UX design and clear communication within the team. The wireframes acted as a reference point throughout the week, reducing potential misalignments in our development phase. By breaking down the user experience into its core elements and ensuring that these elements were user-friendly and functional, we built a solid foundation for the development process. Additionally, this task enhanced my skills in translating abstract ideas into concrete designs and in ensuring the team's alignment through clear, consistent communication.

Next Steps:
Looking forward, the focus will be on refining the interface as my group mate implements the designs, testing the UI for user experience, and ensuring all interactions are smooth and efficient. I will continue to review and adjust the design based on feedback from both the team and any preliminary testing results.

Week 5: Dynamic Order Display and Local Development

Summary of Work
During Week 5, I focused on developing my own version of the application while choosing not to commit my changes to GitHub. My decision to work locally stemmed from a desire to minimize potential conflicts that can arise when multiple team members edit the same file. By isolating my work, I aimed to avoid inadvertently disrupting my teammates' progress or introducing bugs into the shared codebase. This strategy also allowed me to thoroughly debug and test the application, ensuring stability before integrating my code with the team’s work.

Key Improvements
Throughout the week, I encountered several problems that I tackled continuously while writing the code. One of the initial challenges was dynamically building the HTML content to display burger orders. Without a dynamic solution, I would have had to hardcode each order, which is impractical given the variable number of orders. By employing JavaScript’s forEach loop, I dynamically created HTML for each order and its corresponding burgers. This implementation was crucial, as it allowed the application to adapt seamlessly to changing data.

Another important aspect I addressed early on was handling situations where no orders were available. Initially, the display would appear blank if there were no orders, leading to potential confusion for users. To resolve this, I implemented a check that displayed a clear message stating, “No orders yet,” when the order list was empty. This addition improved user feedback, creating a more intuitive experience.

As the week progressed, I also worked on implementing asynchronous data fetching without reloading the entire page. Utilizing XMLHttpRequest, I was able to retrieve order data from the server dynamically. This approach not only enhanced the user experience by minimizing page reloads but also reduced server load by updating only the relevant parts of the page.

I added to the existing code to ensure that the orders the user has made are displayed in the confirmation message. I started by ensuring that the order details could be stored in the session. When the user clicks the "Place Order" button, I included code that collects all information from the cart and stores it in a variable called final_order. Additionally, I created a variable named order_confirmed, which stores the confirmed order details so that they can be displayed on the page later.

Commit Details
I am going to commit this to GitHub. In app.py (BurgerOrderer), I added logic to store the confirmed order in a variable called confirmed_order after the user clicks "Place Order." This ensures that the final order is passed to the template for display. While this step is significant, I acknowledge that the code is not fully complete yet, as there are still important elements to add in the HTML.

Despite my progress, I identified several challenges that I chose to defer until future iterations. One such issue was the lack of automatic updates for the order display. Users had to manually refresh the page to view new orders, which hindered real-time interaction. I recognized the need to implement a feature that automatically updates orders at regular intervals using setInterval, and I planned to tackle this in the coming week.
Another problem I encountered during testing was that if the order container wasn’t cleared before rendering new orders, it could lead to duplication and confusion for users. This was particularly evident during my tests, where old orders remained visible alongside new ones. I aimed to address this issue by ensuring that the container was cleared before each update, which was essential for maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

Additionally, I faced challenges with correctly parsing the JSON data sent from the server. Although the data was in a format that could be utilized by JavaScript, I initially struggled to implement the parsing logic correctly. This was a technical hurdle that I planned to address once the core functionality of the order display was stable.

Reflections on Development Process
Reflecting on my development process, I realized that my decision to work locally enabled me to debug and test thoroughly without interrupting my team’s workflow. However, looking back, I recognize that using a feature branch on GitHub would have allowed me to share my progress with the team while minimizing the risk of conflicts. By creating a separate branch, I could have pushed my code safely and provided my teammates with the opportunity to review my work, facilitating collaboration while still maintaining a clear separation between individual tasks.

Summary
In summary, during Week 5, I successfully resolved key issues such as dynamically generating order content, handling empty order lists, and implementing asynchronous data fetching. I also made significant progress in confirming order details and ensuring they are displayed properly. However, I deferred the implementation of real-time updates, clearing old orders, and effectively handling JSON data parsing to the following week. This approach allowed me to prioritize stability and ensure the application’s functionality was correct before integrating it with the shared codebase.

Week 6: Implementing Real-Time Updates and Finalizing Development

Summary of Work
In Week 6, I dedicated my efforts to resolving the remaining issues in my application and making necessary adjustments to the code. After addressing all outstanding problems, I successfully uploaded the complete code to GitHub, marking a significant milestone in the development process. This step not only allowed my teammates to access my work but also facilitated future collaboration as we moved toward completing the project.

Key Improvements
One of the most critical challenges I tackled was implementing real-time automatic updates for the order status. Previously, users needed to manually refresh the page to see the latest orders, which detracted from the overall user experience. To enhance this functionality, I utilized the setInterval(fetchOrders, 5000) method, which allowed the fetchOrders() function to be called automatically every five seconds. As a result, the application now consistently displays the most recent orders without requiring any action from the user. This improvement significantly enhanced the interactivity and responsiveness of the application, making it more user-friendly.

Another important issue I resolved was ensuring that the display of orders remained clean by avoiding duplication. With the implementation of automatic updates, it was essential to clear the order container before appending new orders. By adding the line ordersContainer.innerHTML = ''; prior to rendering new orders, I ensured that only the latest orders would be visible each time the function executed. This adjustment improved the clarity of the order display and eliminated potential confusion for users.

Additionally, I focused on effectively handling the JSON data sent from the server. Initially, I encountered challenges with parsing the JSON format, which is not directly usable in JavaScript. To address this, I implemented JSON.parse(xhr.responseText), converting the JSON string into a JavaScript object. This conversion allowed me to loop through the orders and display their contents accurately on the page. Proper handling of JSON data was vital for the application to function correctly and for the user interface to present data reliably.

Testing and Debugging
Throughout this week, I prioritized continuous testing and debugging. Utilizing tools such as console logging and breakpoints in the browser’s developer tools, I was able to isolate and address any issues promptly. This proactive approach to debugging ensured that the application remained stable as I made changes.

Reflections on Development Process
Reflecting on my development process, I recognize the importance of thorough testing and clear communication within the team. Uploading my code to GitHub was a significant step that not only showcased my completed work but also facilitated discussions about future improvements and collaborative efforts. I ensured that I provided detailed commit messages that outlined the changes made, which will help my teammates understand the evolution of the codebase.

Insights on Learning and Growth
Looking back on this project, I have gained valuable insights into both the technical and collaborative aspects of software development. I enhanced my programming skills, particularly in handling asynchronous operations and parsing JSON data. I also improved my understanding of user experience design by implementing real-time updates, which taught me the importance of responsiveness in applications. Furthermore, I learned how to communicate effectively with my team, ensuring that we remained aligned in our objectives, even when working independently.

Future Plans
As this was the final week of the project, I am excited about the potential for future enhancements to the application. Although my focus was on resolving existing issues, I envision features such as user account management and a more sophisticated order history system that could further enhance the user experience. Additionally, I plan to explore more advanced data visualization techniques to present order statistics, which could provide valuable insights for users. I believe these improvements will not only elevate the functionality of the application but also strengthen the collaborative efforts within the team as we continue to develop the project.

Conclusion
In summary, Week 6 was a productive culmination of my efforts, as I successfully implemented crucial features and uploaded the complete code to GitHub. The changes I made not only enhance the application’s functionality but also contribute to a more seamless collaborative environment moving forward. Additionally, based on a tip from the lab teacher, I added buttons between the BurgerOrderer and KitchenView to improve navigation. I designed these buttons to be visually appealing and easy to see, which further enhances the user experience by making it simpler to navigate between these components.
