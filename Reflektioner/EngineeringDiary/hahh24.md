Week 1:Initial Setup and Learning Git

During the first week, my team and I met to get familiar with configuration management using Git. We started by making sure everyone downloaded the correct application, as the teacher had emphasized the importance of using the right tools. We chose to use GitHub, a widely-used platform for version control and collaboration.

To better understand how GitHub works, we watched a YouTube tutorial that explained how to create a repository and the meaning of commits. Once our repository was set up, we each practiced making a commit to a shared `main.py` file. This helped us ensure that changes were being tracked correctly.

However, we encountered an issue where some commits were not successfully committed. We realised this was because two people were trying to commit changes at the same time, and the application couldn't handle the simultaneous updates. This resulted in a conflict that prevented some of the changes from being processed. After identifying the problem, we discussed it as a team and decided to take turns making commits to avoid this issue in the future. 

Overall, despite the minor setback, we successfully completed the initial setup and learned how to use Git for our project.

Reflection:

Collaboration  
Our first experience with Git showed the need for better communication. The issue with simultaneous commits taught us to coordinate more effectively, ensuring no one commits to the same file at the same time. Moving forward, we’ll use branches to manage individual tasks and avoid conflicts.

Configuration Management:
We realised the importance of understanding Git’s conflict resolution. While we avoided further issues by committing one at a time, adopting a structured branching strategy will improve our workflow and prevent future problems.


Week 2: Planning:
This week, my team and I met to plan how we would divide the work. We discussed each person’s strengths and previous coding experience to assign tasks accordingly. While we didn’t do any coding, this session was crucial for organising the project and ensuring that everyone understood their roles and responsibilities. The focus was on collaboration and planning for the upcoming tasks, allowing us to move forward efficiently in the weeks to come.

Week 3 : Implementing HTML and CSS

This week, after we finalized the division of tasks within the group, I was assigned the responsibility of implementing the HTML and CSS for the user interface. My task was to design a user-friendly interface that would make it easier for users to place their burger orders. Given my previous experience with HTML and CSS, I felt confident in my ability to handle this aspect of the project.

However, I quickly encountered a challenge: I had no prior experience connecting two different files, and I was unsure how to connect the HTML and CSS front-end with the main application. This gap in my knowledge made the task more complicated than I had anticipated. I spent a significant amount of time researching online, looking for tutorials and guides on how to connect different files. I discovered that there were multiple approaches, and the process was quite complex, involving different tools and technologies.

Some of the solutions I found required learning new programming languages or frameworks, which was initially overwhelming. After exploring several options, I realized that I needed to discuss the situation with my team. We held a meeting to talk about the different methods I had found and evaluated which one would be the most feasible for our project. Given the complexity, we decided that the best approach was to take it one step at a time. Our plan is to first establish a basic connection between the front-end and main application, then gradually add more functionality as we go along.

This experience has taught me the importance of collaboration and seeking advice when facing challenges beyond my expertise. The step-by-step approach we agreed on has helped break down the problem, making it feel more manageable and allowing us to move forward with confidence.

Collaboration:  
This week underscored the value of teamwork. Discussing the database integration challenges with my colleagues helped simplify the task by breaking it into smaller steps. Their input made the problem more manageable.

Learning:
Researching database integration was challenging, but it taught me the importance of a step-by-step approach. By focusing on one part at a time, I was able to make progress without feeling overwhelmed.


Week 4&5:

Over the past weeks, I focused on learning how to connect the main application with the HTML file. This task proved to be more difficult than I anticipated. After struggling with it, my colleague and I agreed that he would handle integrating the HTML with the main application, while I shifted my focus toward learning more about databases and containers. I hoped this knowledge would help me better understand virtual machines and contribute more effectively to the project.

Meanwhile, I continued working on the front-end design. My colleague sent me a wireframe for how the website should look, which provided a clear structure and helped guide the layout of my HTML and CSS code. The wireframe simplified decisions like where to place buttons, ensuring the interface would be user-friendly. This saved me a lot of time, as I didn't have to start from scratch. The framework wasn’t too complex, which worked well because our teacher emphasized functionality over design.

As I implemented the front-end, I wrote the full HTML and CSS code, adjusting colors and adding buttons for customizing burger orders. I then committed the changes to GitHub. One challenge I faced was connecting the HTML file with the external CSS file. I knew it was best practice to keep them separate, but I struggled to make it work. After researching online, I found a solution that suggested embedding the CSS directly within the HTML file using the `<style>` tag. While this wasn’t ideal, it allowed me to proceed and ensure the design worked as intended. While this wasn’t the ideal solution, it allowed me to move forward and ensure the design looked as intended. The code I implemented looked something like this:




    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
            padding: 50px;
            margin: 0;
            color: #333;
        }...
	</style>

Problem-Solving  
This week was challenging as I struggled with connecting the HTML and CSS files. Even though best practice suggests keeping them separate, I had to adapt by embedding the CSS directly into the HTML file to keep moving forward. This taught me that sometimes a temporary workaround is necessary to make progress, even if it’s not the ideal solution.

Learning and Adaptation: 
Although I couldn’t complete the integration of the HTML with the main application, I gained valuable insight into database structures and containers, which will be useful for future tasks. I also realised that I need to improve my understanding of how different parts of an application connect.

Collaboration: 
Discussing the integration issue with my colleague helped us divide the work based on our strengths. Handing over the task of connecting the files to him allowed me to focus on other areas like design and learning about virtual machines. This collaboration helped us maintain progress without getting stuck on one task.
